Program created as part of independent exercise (java course).

## Instruction
> Create a class called Fruit. This class should contain a field
> called calories and method called makeJuice which prints a statement (e.g. "Juice is made"). </br>
> 
> Create two subclasses of the Fruit class (e.g. Apple, Banana) and create method(s) 
> in these classes that are specific to them (e.g. removeSeeds, peel). </br>
> Set the calories within the constructors of these subclasses.
> Override the makeJuice method to print the specific type of juice that's made.
> 
> Create a Market class which test polymorphism by creating several variations of these object.
